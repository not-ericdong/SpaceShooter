HOW TO PLAY



Shoot the UFOS to increase your score!

Don't let them get past the bottom of
the screen or you'll lose a lifepoint!

If you get hit by an enemy projectile or
crash into an enemy ship you will lose health!

Use 'W' 'A' 'S' 'D' keys to move the ship.

Tap or hold the space bar to shoot.

If you have bombs, press 'F' to use a bomb (2 sec cooldown).

Look out for these useful power ups to help you on your adventure!
